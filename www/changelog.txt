Bug Fixes
This version has some bug fixes that make it very much easier to select, resize 
and rotate objects.

When you tap on an object you'll see small squares around the outline of the 
object - we call those 'handles'. If you want to resize something most of the 
time would recommend pressing and dragging the handles in the corner, if you 
choose the handles in the middle that will adjust only the width or the height 
not both.

For those of you who were at the Testing session at Kirkintilloch Health and 
Care Centre on 17th April 2013 this should be a big improvement to the 
frustration we were having trying to manipulate icons.

Also bug fixes to adding/updating asset notes.
